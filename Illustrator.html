In the beginning stages of design, we brainstormed three problems that people today struggle with. I came up with the idea of sustainability and designed the initial idea of a web browser that would rate each clothing store based on sustainability. I then created this design to demonstrate my idea to the class. </h3>

I decided to re-design my dance studio's logo and used Adobe Illustrator to accomplish this. For this project we had to present it to the class on a poster containing this logo, the logo in different colors, and the logo on various products.
